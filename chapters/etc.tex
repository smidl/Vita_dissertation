The CIFAR10~\cite{krizhevsky2009learning}, SVHN22~\cite{netzer2011reading} and MVTec-AD~\cite{bergmann2019mvtec} are publicly available datasets. The WildlifeMNIST and COCOPlaces datasets were created and published by the authors of this paper and are available at \url{https://zenodo.org/record/7602025} and \url{https://zenodo.org/record/7612053}. The data that were produced during the extensive experimental comparison are not publicly available, since they exceed 2TB in size, but the model performance metrics are available upon request from the authors.


All the models were implemented either in PyTorch or in Julia. The code for the proposed model can be found at \url{github.com/vitskvara/sgad} and the evaluation framework is at \url{github.com/vitskvara/GenerativeAD.jl}.
