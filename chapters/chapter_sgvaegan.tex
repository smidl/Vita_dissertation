\chapter{Anomaly detection in multi-factor data}

% write that we have shown that we need some kind of mechanism that is able to learn the individual parts of an image in order to detect semantic anomalies
% we have tried different models of unsupervised disentanglement
% it was shown somewhere theoretically that it is actually impossible
% all succesful disentanglement techniques use some kind of label information
% we will simply expect the image to contain a distinct background and foreground
